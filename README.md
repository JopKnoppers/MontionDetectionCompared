# MontionDetectionCompared

### Here 10 methods wil be compared to see what motion detection works best for the 

Firstly five computer vision methods will be compared:
1.	Background subtraction/Frame Difference Method
2.	Optical flow
3.	Vector based
4.	Phase-based video motion magnification
5.	Gabor filter

Secondly five machine learning methods will be compared:
1.	MODT
2.	Anomaly Detection
3.	WiSARD
4.	DeepFlow
5.	Optical Flow with Generative Adversarial Networks

They will be compared on accuracy and speed.
